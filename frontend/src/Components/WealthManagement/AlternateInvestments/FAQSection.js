      question: "What are the minimum investment requirements?",
      answer: "For Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs), the minimum investment typically starts at â‚¹1 crore. However, this can vary based on the specific fund and investment strategy. We can work with you to find the most suitable investment option based on your portfolio size and objectives."
    },

      question: "How liquid are alternative investments?",
      answer: "Liquidity varies by investment type. While some strategies offer quarterly redemption windows, others may have longer lock-in periods of 3-5 years. Each fund's liquidity terms are clearly outlined in the investment documentation, and we'll help you understand these terms before making any investment decisions."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the tax implications?",
      answer: "Tax treatment varies by investment type. For example, our Equity AIFs handle the tax surcharge at the fund level, making returns tax-free for individual investors. We recommend consulting with your tax advisor for specific advice based on your situation."
    },
    {
      question: "How are alternative investments regulated in India?",
      answer: "Alternative investments in India are regulated by SEBI under the AIF Regulations. These regulations provide a robust framework for investor protection, fund governance, and disclosure requirements. All our funds comply with SEBI regulations and guidelines."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you manage investment risks?",
      answer: "We employ a multi-layered risk management approach including diversification, professional fund management, regular monitoring, and strict investment guidelines. Our team conducts thorough due diligence on all investments and provides regular risk assessment reports."
    },
    {
      question: "What kind of returns can I expect?",
      answer: "Returns vary based on the investment strategy, market conditions, and risk profile. While we aim to deliver superior risk-adjusted returns, it's important to note that past performance is not indicative of future results. We focus on long-term value creation while managing downside risks."
